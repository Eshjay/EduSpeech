          Everyone can talk, but not everyone can express himself or herself in public. In a world that is bombarded with information, mastering the skill set of public speaking is more important today than ever, thus the need to improve our communication skill in order to fit in.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          Communication could be described as the passing of a message from the encoder to the decoder. Therefore, effective communication is what happens when the message that is sent is the same as the message that is received. Public speaking is the effective verbal communication of a message by a speaker to an intended audience. The ability to communicate with confidence and in a good speaking manner cannot be over-emphasised. Your confidence is boosted when the person/people you are engaged with in a public speech/conversation do not laugh at you because of what you say how you speak or your posture and composure but pay rapt attention to your presentation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          Public speaking is a life skill that is required by everyone and not just those for whom public speaking is a career. No matter where you live in the world, public speaking is essential for you to exercise leadership. It is not enough to have a vision, you have to present that vision into clear, concise and persuasive language. When you speak to an audience of more than one person with a specific purpose, it is public speaking.
