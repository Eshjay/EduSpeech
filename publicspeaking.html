          Everyone can talk, but not everyone can express himself or herself in public. In a world that is bombarded with information, mastering the skill set of public speaking is more important today than ever, thus the need to improve our communication skill in order to fit in.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          Communication could be described as the passing of a message from the encoder to the decoder. Therefore, effective communication is what happens when the message that is sent is the same as the message that is received. Public speaking is the effective verbal communication of a message by a speaker to an intended audience. The ability to communicate with confidence and in a good speaking manner cannot be over-emphasised. Your confidence is boosted when the person/people you are engaged with in a public speech/conversation do not laugh at you because of what you say how you speak or your posture and composure but pay rapt attention to your presentation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          Public speaking is a life skill that is required by everyone and not just those for whom public speaking is a career. No matter where you live in the world, public speaking is essential for you to exercise leadership. It is not enough to have a vision, you have to present that vision into clear, concise and persuasive language. When you speak to an audience of more than one person with a specific purpose, it is public speaking.

            <p> had a preconceived notion prior to reading this book that public speakers are born. Fadekemi explained explicitly how effective communication is a byproduct of public speaking. </p> 
            <p> It's not just enough to know what to say but how I  say it makes the difference. She said as a speaker I should propel, influence, and persuade the audience to perform a specific action that would not have taken place in my absence.</p>
             <p> She mentioned that my audience should think, feel and act differently as a direct result of my speech.</p>

            <p class="review-text"> In a generation like this when speech delivery is concomitant with human empowerment and skill development which is a formidable force for industrialisation and national development, we cannot afford to be shabby about this noble art. </p> 
            <p> Several materials abound on skills and techniques for speech delivery and motivational talks which seems too sophisticated for a beginner, this piece addresses the basic step for a beginner in speech delivery yet, an average speaker can find new light from the set guide in the book. </p> 
            <p> I am particularly interested in the simplicity of the language and presentation of the book which makes it appreciable to every class of individual.</p> 
            <p> The writer herself being a seasoned speaker and a linguist points at basic flaws encountered by starters in this noble art of speech delivery, to which she succinctly provided first aid remedy. In a way, virtually everybody presents some speech at one time or the other, whether small scale or large scale, hence, the book is relevant for every individual who intends to speak in public, gets mesmerised with some level of respect and dignity.</p>
